The repository contains the followings:

UCI HAR Dataset folder:  This is the original data set used to generate the tidy data sets required
by the project.  This is obtained from project web page https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project



- tidy_data.txt : This generated data set is to satisfy steps 1,2,3,4 of project assignment.
This includes both test and training data for mean and std function variables. 
for each subject and activity.


- tidy_data_by_activity_subject.txt : This generated data set is to satisfy step 5 of the project 
assignment.  It is the mean for each variable of tidy_data.txt data set above grouped by activity 
and subject. 


- get_clean_data_proj.R:  Is the r script file that will generate the above two data sets.
